# Legendary Value

## Explanation

Do you like Ancient history? In those times, there was no computer. Rumor has it that once there was a king that passed a challenge across the town. He created a long list of integer numbers and asked people to find those pairs that add up to a special number he called the 'legendary value'.

Write a function that takes the legendary value v and a list of integer numbers l and finds all pairs of the numbers that add up to v. For example for the legendary value 10 and the list {1, 3, 4, 2, 9, 5, 9}, the output is {1, 9, 1, 9}.

## Test cases

Input:

	{1, 3, 4, 2, 9, 5, 9} and 10
Output:

    {1, 9, 1, 9}

Input:

	{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and 7
Output:

    {1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4}
