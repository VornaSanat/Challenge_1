# We Have a Challenge for You

## Introduction

Do you love programming? We have a challenge for you!
There are a couple of subdirectories here. Each subdirectory contains a challenge for you. You have to complete the challenge according to its description.

## Things to Consider

Please pay attention to the following points:
1. Your code should work and output the correct results.
2. Efficiency is important. Try to find the best algorithms in terms of memory and performance.
3. Coding style matters.
4. Your code should be clean and readable. This may using proper names, good codebase architecture and providing the appropriate level of abstraction. Following the SOLID principles is also appreciated.
5. Explanatory comments may help. Normally we expect the code to speak for itself. But when it does not, a brief explanation may improve readability.
6. Development time is a factor. We are not in a rush, but you may brag about your skills by showing us how fast you complete each challenge.

## So what am I supposed to do?

- Fork this repository.
- Read the readme file in each subdirectory.
- Complete the challenge based on the description.
- Push your code and other valuable resources into your repository.
- Send us a pull request, we will review and get back to you.

Thank you very much.
